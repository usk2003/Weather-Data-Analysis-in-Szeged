# **Weather Data Analysis in Szeged (2006-2016)**

**Introduction**

In this project, we analyze weather data from Szeged, Hungary, spanning the years 2006 to 2016. The dataset includes various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and precipitation type. By exploring this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships among these features through a series of statistical and machine learning techniques. The project is divided into multiple parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analysis, including preprocessing, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection.

**Objectives**

1. Understand the distribution and relationships among different weather features.
2. Apply various statistical techniques to gain insights into the data.
3. Use dimensionality reduction methods to visualize the high-dimensional data.
4. Identify significant features that influence weather patterns in Szeged.

Let's begin our exploration of the weather data in Szeged.

"""# Overall Insights

## Summary

Throughout this project, we systematically explored and analyzed the weather data in Szeged from 2006 to 2016. Our analyses included data preprocessing, statistical exploration, correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection. Each part of the project contributed to a deeper understanding of the dataset, culminating in a comprehensive overview of weather patterns in Szeged.

## Key Insights

1. **Temperature and Humidity**: Temperature and humidity are moderately correlated, indicating that higher temperatures generally correspond to higher humidity levels.
2. **Wind Speed and Visibility**: There is a noticeable correlation between wind speed and visibility, suggesting that higher wind speeds may lead to better visibility conditions.
3. **Precipitation Type**: The distribution of precipitation types shows that rain is more common than snow in Szeged during the analyzed period.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA and SVD effectively reduced the dimensionality of the data, revealing underlying structures and patterns that facilitate easier interpretation and analysis.
5. **Feature Selection**: Techniques like LDA and SelectKBest highlighted the most influential features for predicting precipitation types, aiding in the simplification and refinement of the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the weather patterns in Szeged, leveraging various data analysis techniques. The findings can be used to inform further studies and applications in meteorology and environmental science. By understanding the relationships and patterns within the weather data, we can better predict and respond to future weather events.

## Information about SVM Model and Training

In this analysis, we are comparing two different machine learning models: a linear regression model and a support vector machine (SVM) model. Initially, we preprocess the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns and splitting it into features (`X`) and target (`y`). For the linear regression model, we use a pipeline that includes standard scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set, followed by fitting a linear regression model to predict the temperature.

For the SVM model, we convert the regression target (`y`) into a binary classification problem by categorizing the temperature as above or below the median value. This allows us to train an SVM classifier. Similar to the linear regression model, the SVM model pipeline includes standard scaling and PCA for dimensionality reduction. The SVM model is then trained using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The performance of each model is evaluated using different metrics: R-squared for the linear regression model and accuracy for the SVM model.

"""### Conclusion of the Analysis

In this analysis, we compared the performance of two machine learning models: a linear regression model with PCA and an SVM classifier with PCA. The linear regression model's performance was measured using the R-squared metric, while the SVM classifier's performance was measured using accuracy.

The results showed that the linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of `existing_accuracy`, while the SVM model achieved an accuracy of `svm_accuracy`. Based on these results, we concluded that the `svm_model_performance_comparison` model performs better. This comparison highlights the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics and considering different model architectures when analyzing machine learning problems.
